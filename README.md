# Mini-project---Console-Based-Chat-System-using-Python-using-OOP-
This project is a console-based Chat System built using Python and OOP concepts. It simulates how a basic chat application works: users can join a chat room, send messages, view chat history, and leave the chat room. 

Users can join or leave a chat room, send messages, and view the full chat history. Each message is automatically assigned a unique ID, which helped me learn how class variables work in real scenarios.

The system allows users to join and leave chat rooms, send messages, and view complete chat history. Each message is assigned a unique ID using a class variable, ensuring proper message tracking. The project demonstrates effective use of encapsulation, class relationships, and object interaction while maintaining clean and modular code
